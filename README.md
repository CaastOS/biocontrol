Project Idea:

Using the wheeled robot that interacts with a defined circle on the floor. A camera mounted above the table will track the setup from a top-down perspective. The robot's main task will be to navigate to the circle and use a snowplow mechanism to clear it out. If time permits, weâ€™d like to add a color-sorting feature as an extra challenge.
